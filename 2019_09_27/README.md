# Word Search

Count the occurrences of the word INSURANCE in the given grid.

You may search using the **traditional word search** rules:
- letters along a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line
- words may be either forwards or backwards

You can also choose to use the **snaking puzzle** rules:
- the path can change direction between letters (letters just have to be next to each other and do not have to be in a straight line)
- a single word cannot use the same field multiple times

In both versions, the same field may be used by multiple words.
