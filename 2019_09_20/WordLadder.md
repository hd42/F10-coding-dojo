# Word Ladder

Word ladder is a word puzzle where the challenge is to build a chain of words, given a **start word** and **end word**. All words must be valid words from a dictionary. Each word must differ from the previous word by exactly one letter. 

*Example:*

    COLD -> CORD -> CARD -> WARD -> WARM

## Input

* `dict.txt`: a list of all eligible words, each line containing a word.

You can choose your own start and end word. Three ladder word chains are easy to start with. Using words with more than five letters would make it quite rare to be able to find any solutions.

## Bonus Challenges

As a bonus challenge, you can try to find the shortest word chain with a given start and end word. For example, the shortest word chains with the start word **COLD** and end word **WARM** have a length of 5. There are 7 possible solutions with the same length.
